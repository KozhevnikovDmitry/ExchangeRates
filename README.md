EchangeRates
===========

Test task#1 implementation for vacancy http://www.interesnee.ru/join-our-team/25/dotnet-developer

Application provides charts of dynamics of exchange rates for particular currency. Application has layred architecture. Layers are separated in assemblies, also there are couple assemblies with tests. May be it is too complicated solution for so small task. I would develop similar, but much more functional and rich, application this way.
